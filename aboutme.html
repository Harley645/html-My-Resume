<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
    Hello I am Harley Lim. I have a new found passion for computer programming and web development.
     This passion began because of a peer I talked to. The way they explained what they did in life made me consider programming and web development as an
      option for what I'd want to do in the future. After watching youtube videos about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I purchased a course from Udemy
      "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp". As I am going through the course I am genuienly enjoying everything that I am learning. I hope to continue
      on this path and become a software engineer in the future.
